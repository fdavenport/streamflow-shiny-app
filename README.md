This is an interactive tool made using the R Shiny package. 
You can import streamflow data directly from any USGS streamgage (at least those that archive daily mean flow) and adjust graphing parameters to compare various years. This is something I made out of curiousity and to help visualize some of the data in my research. Feel free to test it out and let me know if you have comments or find it useful!

In the future we may add some additional features:
- comparing multiple gages at once
- Select All/Unselect All buttons to manually select years
